This program is hereby put in the public domain. Do with it whatever
you want, but I would like you not to redistribute it in modified form
without mentioning the fact of modification. I will accept bug reports
and modification requests, without any obligation of course, but fixing
bugs someone else put in is beyond me.

When you report bugs please mention the version number in the source
files, and preferably send context diffs if you changed anything.
I might put in your fixes, and distribute a new version someday.

I would prefer if you did *not* use this program for generating hands
for tournaments. I have not investigated the random number generation
closely enough for me to be comfortable with that thought.
If you want to deal for tournaments use my BigDeal program.
